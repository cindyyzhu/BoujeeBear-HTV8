<!-- Inspiration -->
## 💡Inspiration💡
A speech impediment in a child arises when their oral components - the mouth, jaw, tongue, and vocal tract - face challenges in coordinating to articulate clear words.
<br>
<br>
Around 5% to 15% of the population is impacted by developmental learning disabilities (LDs, as per the American Psychiatric Association's 2013 data).
<br>
<br>
This project functions as a supportive companion for both children and their speech educators, providing an excellent means for kids to practice speech improvement comfortably at home while making learning to rectify speech issues engaging through game-based activities.

#### 🎚️Levels🎚️

Within Boujee Bear, there are three main levels: _Easy, Medium, and Hard_. For the flashcard game, users will be asked to pronounce words based on increasing levels of difficulty. Below is a chart for more detailed descriptions of each individual level.
- **Easy Level**: Here, there are a variety of words that are slightly or mildly difficult to pronounce for those with speech impediments (i.e. lisps, stutters, etc,.). These include simple words with repeated sounds or "r" sounds.
- **Medium Level**:  Within the medium level, there are a variety of words that are moderately more difficult to pronounce. These include more complex words with repeated sounds, soft syllables, and rolling "r" sounds.
- **Hard Level**: In the hard level, there are more challenging words that are meant to challenge the target audience to ameliorate their pronounciation skills and practice their speaking, thereby improving their confidence. Here, there are a variety of words that feature "s" sounds, which is considered as one of the most difficult types of words for individuals to pronounce. 

## 👀Future Plans👀

At Boujee Bear, we are driven by a compelling vision for the future. Our goal is to provide unparalleled support for individuals with speech difficulties, tailoring our solutions to address each person's unique challenges, such as difficulty pronouncing words with "r" sounds. We aim to make a lasting impact by enhancing our platform in the following ways:

**1. Personalized Customization:** Our commitment to individualized customization will remain unwavering. We're dedicated to fine-tuning our technology to suit the specific needs of every user, making their journey towards better speech effortless and effective.

**2. Project Scope Expansion:** Furthermore, we have strategic plans to extend the scope of our project to encompass sentences, dialogues, and individuals with diverse accents. These initiatives hold the potential to greatly assist individuals who are in the process of immigrating to English-speaking countries by facilitating their adaptation to local languages and cultures, thus diminishing the linguistic barriers between individuals.

**3. Integration of AI:** To propel our mission forward, we will integrate cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, playing a pivotal role in enhancing the personalization or our platform, resulting in more significant improvements in the speaking skills of our users. We're excited about the potential this will unlock and are committed to staying at the forefront of technological innovation.

With these ambitious and visionary steps, we aspire to create a future where speech difficulties no longer limit the full potential of individuals. Our journey is marked by progress, innovation, and inclusivity, and we invite you to join us as we pave the way toward a more connected and communicative globalized new era.
