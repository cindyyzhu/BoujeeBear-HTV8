<!-- Inspiration -->
## Inspiration
A speech impediment in a child arises when their oral components - the mouth, jaw, tongue, and vocal tract - face challenges in coordinating to articulate clear words.
<br>
<br>
Around 5% to 15% of the population is impacted by developmental learning disabilities (LDs, as per the American Psychiatric Association's 2013 data).
<br>
<br>
This project functions as a supportive companion for both children and their speech educators, providing an excellent means for kids to practice speech improvement comfortably at home while making learning to rectify speech issues engaging through game-based activities.

#### Levels

Within Boujee Bear, there are three main levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. For the flashcard game, users will be asked to pronounce words based on increasing levels of difficulty. Below is a chart for more detailed descriptions of each individual level.
- **Easy Level**: Here, there are a variety of words that are slightly or mildly difficult to pronounce for those with speech impediments (i.e. lisps, stutters, etc,.). These include simple words with repeated sounds or "r" sounds.
- **Medium Level**:  Within the medium level, there are a variety of words that are moderately more difficult to pronounce. These include more complex words with repeated sounds, soft syllables, and rolling "r" sounds.
- **Hard Level**: In the hard level, there are more challenging words that are meant to challenge the target audience to ameliorate their pronounciation skills and practice their speaking, thereby improving their confidence. Here, there are a variety of words that feature "s" sounds, which is considered as one of the most difficult types of words for individuals to pronounce. 

## Future Plans

## Challenges

- Diversity Aspect:
Helps individuals from any type of culture or ethnicity improve their English speaking skills (especially those with accents)

<br>

- Sustainability Aspect:
Once these users complete enough levels to improve their speech, they get the ability to “plant a tree”

<br>
- Artificial Intelligence Aspect:
Uses AI to determine methods for an individual to improve upon their speaking skills
